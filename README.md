# Rick Sanchez Bot

This project demonstrates how to create a conversational AI bot inspired by Rick Sanchez from the animated series *Rick and Morty* using Hugging Face's Transformers library and fine-tuning a DialoGPT model.

## Overview

The Rick Sanchez Bot leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP) to engage users in conversations mimicking Rick Sanchez's distinctive personality. By fine-tuning a pre-trained DialoGPT model, this project aims to deliver entertaining and contextually relevant responses.
